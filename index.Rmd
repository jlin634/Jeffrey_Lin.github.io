# About Jeffrey Lin

Hi everyone! My name is Jeffrey Lin and I am a current candidate for a Master 
of Science in Biostatistics at Columbia University Mailman School of Public 
Health. I completed my undergraduate education at Tufts University, graduating 
with a BS in Cognitive and Brain Sciences, as well as a minor in Computer 
Science. My research interests generally focus on designing models which 
can aid in the classification and prediction of diseases for patients. In 
my free time, I enjoy playing basketball and practicing Judo and Brazilian 
Jiu Jitsu.
